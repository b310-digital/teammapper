      <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
      <ul type="disc">
          <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
          <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
          <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>

          We have installed the web analysis service / open-source software "Matomo" on our website to analyze and improve the usage of our website.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data category and description of data processing: </strong>IP address, technical information about browser and provider in addition to device, location and pages visited (excluding all created mindmap pages). The software is configured to disable the storage of cookies. We have enabled "IP Anonymisation", which truncates your IP address by the last 6 digits. As a result, the data can no longer be linked to an individual. Furthermore, this IP is not merged with other data collected by us. The data is processed and stored on our server in Germany.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose of processing</strong> This data is collected and stored for the purposes of analysis, and optimization of our website.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> The legal basis is our legitimate interest in data processing for the purposes mentioned above according to Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR. For services related to a contract, tracking and analysis of user behavior are carried out according to Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b) GDPR, in order to be able to offer optimized services for fulfilling the purpose of the contract with the information gained.</li>
        <li><strong>Duration of storage:</strong> After data collection, the data is anonymized. Cookies are not stored. Server logs are automatically deleted after 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Objection:</strong> You may object to the data collection and storage at any time free of charge with effect for the future.
        </li>
        <li>For further information, please refer to Matomo's privacy policy at: https://matomo.org/privacy/.</li>

      <h4>Cookies</h4>
      <h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
      <p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p>
      <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
      <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
      <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
      <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
      <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>

      <p>Currently, there are no third-party cookies used.</p>
      <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
      <p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p>
      <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.</p>

      <h4>User mindmaps, nodes, images, links, texts</h4>
      <p>We offer you the opportunity to post mindmap content such as images, links and texts on our website, hereinafter referred to jointly as "posts." If you make use of this opportunity, we will process and publish your post, the date and time you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may have used.</p>
      <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.</p>
      <p>In addition, we will also process your IP address. The IP address is processed because we might have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your post infringes the rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful.</p>
      <p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any legal defense we may have to mount.</p>

      <h4>Deletion of mindmaps</h4>
      <p>As this is a demo instance, mindmaps are deleted automatically after being inactive. The source code is freely available and you can host it yourself for full control.</p>
