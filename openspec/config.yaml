# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
rules:
  proposal:
    - Keep proposals under 500 words
    - Always include a "Non-goals" section
  tasks:
    - Structure tasks in sections that are good estimates for common pull / merge requests
    - Use feature flags if needed, so that after each section the app is still working
